# FamilyTreeManager
open family tree manager

what:

this is a nice tool to gather a whole family with all partners, kids, parents, together with special places (birth, marriage, ...), dates, ...
it is based on spreadsheet files instead of black-box-databases, so everything is easy to access
output as graphical html is integrated as well as an export as KML-file, ready to import in google MAPS

why:

it`s a long story started 40 years ago with questionary at birtday parties: "who is that?".

40 years ago i asked that to my parents and we started to gather the informathion. 
Free tools to manage were rare at these early days! 
so i started with 1st ideas to prepare something with quick basic. - worked well but bit stubborn.

16 years ago, my kids started to ask me the same questions. so we updated the data summary.
Free tools to manage were still rare at these days and they were not handy!
so i started again with this ideas to prepare something - this time with Turbo Pascal. - worked better.

now, during a cleanup, i found again the mass of documentations on paper from the past 40 years - lot of "streams" were gathering in the meanwhile.
still i was not able to find an existing free and nice tool - either free - or nice.
So i startet again to prepare a tool - this time in VBA => excel is great for quick developping.
to make it short - VBA did quickly quit, so i changed to powershell and there we are.

support:

not really.
give me a note - ideas are always welcome as well as bug reports, ...
but it is a hobby only for me - so it might take a bit time till i answer
and - sorry - it is german at the moment.
the language support is integrated but i didn`t yet find the time to translate the wordsDB
an easy HowTo prepare and integrate an own language DB is documented in the "Beschreibung.pdf"
